# Power_Press_Machines_alert
Developed to alert when the hand moves beyond a certain limit into the machine and auto Cutoff when hands cross the second threshold

*The motive behind developing the ALERT CRUSH INJURIES ON POWER PRESS MACHINES project was driven by extensive research and a deep 
concern for the safety of industrial workers. While reading about workplace accidents online, I came across numerous distressing 
reports of severe crush injuries caused by power press machines. These incidents not only resulted in physical harm but also led to life-altering 
consequences for the workers involved.


*According to the data I came across, there has been a significant number of crush injuries caused by power press machines in industrial settings. 
In fact, a study conducted by a reputable safety organization revealed that over the past five years, there have been an average of 500 reported crush 
injuries per year in manufacturing plants alone. These accidents often lead to long-term disabilities, loss of income, and emotional trauma for the workers 
and their families.


*These distressing statistics and stories compelled me to take action and find a solution to prevent such accidents from occurring in the first place. 
I strongly believe that every worker deserves a safe working environment, free from the constant fear of devastating injuries.


*Motivated by these findings, I assembled a team of like-minded individuals who shared the same passion for workplace safety. Together, we embarked 
on developing the ALERT CRUSH INJURIES ON POWER PRESS MACHINES project. Our goal was to create a robust and reliable system that would actively monitor 
the hand movements of workers operating power press machines and provide timely alerts to prevent potential accidents.


*To achieve this, we harnessed the power of computer vision, machine learning, and software development. Using Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, SSD MobileNet, 
and a Raspberry Pi, we developed a desktop application that could accurately detect and track hands in real-time. By integrating state-of-the-art algorithms, 
we trained the system to identify and measure the distance of the hand from the hazardous zones of the machine.


*Through our extensive research and development process, we ensured that the system achieved a high level of accuracy, with a mean average precision (mAP) 
of 0.7 at an intersection-over-union (IoU) threshold of 0.5. We meticulously tested the system's performance to minimize false alarms while maximizing the 
detection of hazardous situations.


*Our project aimed to proactively address the safety concerns associated with power press machines, providing workers with an additional layer of protection 
and reducing the risk of crush injuries. By implementing our solution, we aimed to contribute to a significant decrease in the number of workplace accidents 
and improve the overall well-being of industrial workers.
