The motive behind developing the ALERT CRUSH INJURIES ON POWER PRESS MACHINES project was to address a crucial safety issue prevalent in industrial settings, specifically in the operation of power press machines. These machines pose a significant risk of crush injuries, and it is essential to minimize accidents and protect workers' well-being.

During my time working in the manufacturing industry, I witnessed a few unfortunate incidents where workers suffered severe injuries due to their hands unintentionally moving into the machine's dangerous zones. These accidents not only caused physical harm but also resulted in significant emotional distress for both the victims and their colleagues.

Motivated by these incidents, my team and I decided to leverage our skills and expertise in computer vision, machine learning, and software development to create a solution that could prevent such accidents and save lives. We wanted to design a system that could actively monitor the hand movements of workers operating power press machines and provide real-time alerts whenever a hand moves beyond a certain limit into the machine's hazardous area.

To achieve this, we developed a desktop application that utilized Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, SSD MobileNet, and a Raspberry Pi for implementation. By integrating computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms, we trained the system to accurately detect and track hands in real-time. We set specific thresholds based on the machine's dangerous zones, and whenever a hand crossed the first threshold, an alert would be generated, warning the worker to retract their hand immediately. Moreover, if the hand moved further and crossed the second threshold, the system would automatically trigger a cutoff mechanism to stop the machine's operation and prevent any potential injuries.

During the development phase, we rigorously tested the system's accuracy and performance, ensuring that it achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.7 at an intersection-over-union (IoU) threshold of 0.5. We wanted to ensure that the system would be highly reliable and effectively minimize false alarms while accurately identifying hazardous situations.

Overall, our project aimed to proactively address the safety concerns associated with power press machines, providing workers with an additional layer of protection and reducing the risk of crush injuries. Our motivation stemmed from a genuine concern for the well-being of industrial workers, and we are proud of the solution we have developed, which has the potential to make a significant positive impact on workplace safety.
